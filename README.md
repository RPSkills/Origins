# Origins

> A Vintage Story mod that replaces vanilla classes, creating a larger problem space for game mecahnics.

## Introduction

Vintage Story is a game that encourages the form of multiplayer servers, where players are encouraged to specialize in areas of gameplay out of necessity or preference.
The main goal of Origins is to add depth to the monotonous roles required to establish and sustain a settlement.
We, the developers, plan to revamp the Class system from the VSSurvival mod (i.e. the base game).
To accomplish this, we are:

- reflavoring and extending the current list of playable classes,
- furthering the representation of proficiencies, Skills,  associated with each 'Origin';
  - by increasing the 'skill ceiling' related to aforementioned roles and
  - introducing mechanical complexity in each player's character to represent their role in a larger community
- adding a specialization system defining a set of play styles to accomplish the end-goal of each role

## Plan

This repository is for the Core mod.
Development lifecycle is SCRUM-based.
The completeness of the reposiory is represented by Tiers 0 through 3, which describe feature scope and code base quality.
